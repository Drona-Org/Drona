    <h2><u>Framework Demo</u></h2>
	<p> 
	In this video, we provide an overview of how the framework can be used for interacting with <a href="https://github.com/PX4/Firmware">PX4</a> firmware.
	We show how the programming language <a href="https://github.com/p-org/P">P</a> can be used to program a simple drone software stack and drive a drone in <a href = "https://pixhawk.org/dev/hil/jmavsim">jMavSim</a> simulator.
	The generated trace during simulation is visualized live in a state-machine visualization tool DGML.

    <h2><u>Surveillance Application</u></h2>
  <p> 
  In this video, we ask the drone to survey the city in Gazebo simulator. The points to be visited by the drone are generated randomly.
  The autonomous drone computes a safe plan from its location to the next survey point and follows the trajectory robustly.

  <h2><u>Online-monitoring during mission</u></h2>
  <p> 
  In this video, we ask the drone to survey the city in Gazebo simulator.
  The autonomous drone computes a safe plan from its location to the next survey point and follows the trajectory robustly.
  To demonstrate the runtime-monitoring capabilities in Drona, we monitor each trajectory against a specification that the followed trajectory must lie within a tube. The graphs generated during the simulation present the robustness of the trajectory. During the simulation you can notice that for one of the trajectories the robustness becomes (red) negative, indicating that the drone violated the assumption during runtime. 
  You can also notice that in some cases the robustness becomes orange (close to zero) which can be used as an indication to take pre-emptive steps.
